I surrender my soul Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne in Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me I'll die with honor and pride
The right of a warrior forever to fight by your side

Send a sign raise the sail wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling immortality be mine

Call the witch to cast the runes, weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born not for heaven not for hell

We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky
